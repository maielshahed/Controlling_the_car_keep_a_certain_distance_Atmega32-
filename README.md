Controlling the car keep a certain distance Atmega32  

Description: A robot moves according to a specific distance between it and the body in which it is located, which we call the green zone. If the body is inside the green zone, the robot begins to move away according to the distance of the specified zone. If the body is far from the green zone, the robot begins to move to the interval between it and the body according to the specified distance (the green zone).

Detect the body using the ultrasonic sensor and move the robot accordingly using the L293D motor driver to control the movement and directions of the motor, and use pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the speed of the motor.

Drivers: (Ultrasonic Sensor, servo moto,GPIO,Motor Driver IC L293D , Timer, UART, and DC-Motor).

Microcontroller: ATmega32
